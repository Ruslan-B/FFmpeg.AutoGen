# Important
**The FFmpeg API is vast and complex and this project exposes it with minimum modifications - support is very limited.
Please consider to ask *how to* questions on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=ffmpeg%20autogen) or in special repository on [github.com](https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen.Questions/issues). 
The community may be able to offer some assistance but you will largely be on your own.
As another option you can search for a solution in C(lang) as with some effort you can convert it to C#.**

FFmpeg auto generated unsafe bindings for C#/.NET and Mono.

## Usage

The basic example of the library usage: video decoding, conversion and frame extraction to jpeg is included in ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.Example``` project.  
For the more sophisticated operations please refer to offical [ffmpeg Documentation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) expecially API section of it.
Nuget packages version uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and in sync with MAJOR and MINOR version of FFmpeg as PATCH incremets does not changing API.

- on Windows:  
Native ffmpeg libraries are pre bundled in this repository, please note the are GPL(!) libraries. 
The x64 libraries source from [CODEX FFMPEG](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
Please check to example project it shows how specify path to libraries.  

- on OS X:  
Install ffmpeg via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
Normally you need to set static ```ffmpeg.RootPath = ``` with full path to FFmpeg libraries.

- on Linux:  
Use your package manager of choice.
Normally you need to set static ```ffmpeg.RootPath = ``` with full path to FFmpeg libraries.

## Generation

The bindings generator uses [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp).

Prerequisites:
 - Visual Studio 2019 with C# and C++ desktop development workloads and Windows SDK for desktop.

Steps to generate:
- Run ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.CppSharpUnsafeGenerator;```
